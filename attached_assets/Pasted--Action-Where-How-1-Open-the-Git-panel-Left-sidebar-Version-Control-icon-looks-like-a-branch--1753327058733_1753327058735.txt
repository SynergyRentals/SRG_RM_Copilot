Done. CI is green, your main branch now runs on the new OpenAI SDK.

Path B – Do it directly on GitHub (if you’d rather avoid Replit)
Create the branch

GitHub → Code tab → Branch: main dropdown → Find/create a branch → type migrate/openai-sdk-1x → Create branch.

Replace codex_generate.py

Navigate: .github/scripts/codex_generate.py → ✏️ Edit.

Open codex_generate_updated.py in a second tab, copy everything (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C).

Back in the edit window, select‑all, paste.

Commit at bottom (leave “Commit directly to this branch” checked).

Update requirements.txt

If the file exists: open it → ✏️ Edit → replace contents with text from requirements_updated.txt → Commit.

If it doesn’t exist: top of repo → Add file → Create new file → type requirements.txt → paste content → Commit.

Open the PR

GitHub auto‑shows a yellow banner “Compare & pull request”. Click it.

PR title & description: paste the text in PR_INSTRUCTIONS.md.

Create pull request.

Watch CI

In PR, click Checks → wait for ai_task job to turn green.

When green: Merge pull request → Confirm merge → Delete branch.

Sanity‑check after merge
bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main
ISSUE_BODY='test' OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY \
python .github/scripts/codex_generate.py
No traceback = migration succeeded.

That’s it. Follow the eight clicks in Path A (or five steps in Path B) and the pipeline will be unblocked. Ping me if any step throws an error.
