## API Usage

‚ö†Ô∏è This app is **read‚Äëonly** with Wheelhouse and Guesty. All HTTP requests are GET.

## Manual Admin Endpoints

### Sync Listings from Wheelhouse
```bash
POST /api/admin/syncListings
```

Fetches all listings from Wheelhouse API and upserts them into the database. Uses the `X-Integration-Api-Key` header for authentication (read-only access).

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Listings sync completed",
  "syncedCount": 12,
  "totalListings": 12
}
```

### Manual Data Refresh
```bash
POST /api/admin/refreshNow
```

Immediately triggers data collection for all listings in the database. Fetches performance data from Wheelhouse and market data from AirDNA/Rabbu.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Manual refresh completed",
  "wheelhouseRows": 12,
  "marketRows": 8,
  "listingsSynced": 12
}
```

Both endpoints require admin access and are designed for operational maintenance.

### Performance Monitoring & Alerts
- Z-score analysis (1.5œÉ below benchmark triggers alerts)
- Real-time performance notifications
- Automated underperformance detection
- Critical alert escalation system

## üîß Configuration

The platform uses `src/config/rm-brain.ts` for core configuration:

```typescript
export const RM_BRAIN_CONFIG = {
  WEIGHT_CAP_PCT: 0.10,        // ¬±10% weight cap
  AB_MODE: 'all',              // 100% AI blend coverage
  AI: {
    CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD: 0.85,
    EXCELLENT_SCORE_THRESHOLD: 90,
    OPTIMIZED_SCORE_THRESHOLD: 80,
  },
  ALERTS: {
    Z_SCORE_THRESHOLD: -1.5,   // 1.5œÉ below benchmark
    DECLINE_THRESHOLD_PCT: -15,
    CRITICAL_DECLINE_PCT: -25,
  }
};
